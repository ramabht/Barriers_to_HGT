Files recieved had been through fastqc and Adaptor Removal.
 
 Each sample had three files:
 .fw.fastqc.gz = unmerged forward reads (available in Barriers_to_HGT/raw_reads)
 .rw.fastqc.gz = unmerged reverse reads (available in Barriers_to_HGT/raw_reads)
 .se.fastqc.gz = merged reads (available at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/44dtg2m6y9/1)
